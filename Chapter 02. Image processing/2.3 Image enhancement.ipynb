It accomplishes this by effectively spreading out the most frequent intensity values, i.e. stretching out the intensity range of the image so each possible pixel intensity appears the same number of times as every other value. This method usually increases the global contrast of images when its usable data is represented by close contrast values. This allows for areas of lower local contrast to gain a higher contrast.\n",
